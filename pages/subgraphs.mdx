## Ormi 


[Ormi](https://www.ormilabs.xyz/) powers ApeChain subgraphs which are fully compatible with The Graph's hosted and decentralized networks, adhering to the same specifications. They seamlessly index data from both the ApeChain mainnet and testnets, allowing developers to easily build applications for ApeChain. Read more on how to create your [account](apechain.0xgraph.xyz) deploy your own [subgraph](https://docs.ormi.xyz/apechain-subgraphs) on ApeChain. 



For developers who are already familiar with Graph Protocol tooling, below are the network definitions to deploy subgraphs on ApeChain. These settings can be configured in the subgraph.yaml file:

{/* ``` solidity copy 
network: 'apechain'
```

```solidity copy
network: 'apechain-curtis'
``` */}


| Network  |        |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Mainnet  | `network: 'apechain'`       |
| Curtis   | `network: 'apechain-curtis'`|






## Goldsky
â€‹
[Goldsky](https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/apechain) is a high-performance data indexing solution tailored for ApeChain, enabling seamless extraction, transformation, and loading of on-chain data to ApeChain's applications and analytics. It offers two core methods for accessing ApeChain data: 
[subgraphs](https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs/introduction)
designed for high-performance queries, and 
[mirror](https://docs.goldsky.com/mirror/introduction), providing real-time data replication pipelines.



| Network        | Subgraphs   | Mirror |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Mainnet | Yes |Yes |
| Curtis  |	Yes | Yes | 



Check out their [step by step guide](https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs/deploying-subgraphs) to learn how to deploy a [subgraph](https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/apechain#subgraphs) and or [mirror](https://docs.goldsky.com/reference/config-file/pipeline) for ApeChain. It covers deploying via CLI using a local subgraph configuration file and creating instant subgraphs by providing a contract address and its ABI.
